/**
 * Often in programming, we have resources that are 'scoped' to some lifetime.
 * They often have an explicit
 * - 'acquire' and
 * - 'release' phase
 *
 * Recently TypeScript introduced the 'using' keyword to help with this
 * But it's limited as you don't have very fine control over the lifetime of the resource:
 * It always releases at the end of the block
 * ___
 *
 * Effect has a way to manage resources in a more fine-grained way with the `Scope` type.
 *
 * Think of a `Scope` as an array of effects that run when the scope is closed;
 *
 * Note:
 * Unlike basically everything else in effect, scopes are mutable!
 * But it makes sense, because we have to be able to add to them after the scope is created
