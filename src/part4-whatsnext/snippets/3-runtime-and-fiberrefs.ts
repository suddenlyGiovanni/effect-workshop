/**
 * Next up is `FiberRefs`, which is really just a collection of `FiberRef`s.
 *
 * A `FiberRef` is a mutable reference that is local to a single fiber (like a thread-local variable)
 * They are useful for storing contextual state, with a sensible default value.
 *
 * Consider many things we have encountered so far:
 * concurrency level, log level, context - these are all stored in a `FiberRef`
 * tracing is also a great example of a `FiberRef`, where we store the current span in a `FiberRef`
 *
 *
 *
 * Q: how do they actually work?
 *
 * A `FiberRef` is really just an identifier with an initial value.
 * By default, the value of a `FiberRef` is the initial value
 * Each fiber has its own map of `FiberRef`s to values
 * When we modify a `FiberRef`, we are only modifying the value for the current fiber.

/**
 * Notice how the annotation is different for each fiber,
 * and the main fiber does NOT have its initial value as the final value.
 *
 * This is because FiberRefs have well defined `fork` and `join` semantics;
 *
 * - When a fiber is `forked`, the new fiber gets a copy of the current fibers `FiberRef` values,
 * 	but this can be customized per `FiberRef`.
 *
 * - When a fiber is `joined`, the values of the joined fibers are merged into the current fibers values
 * 	again, this can be customized per `FiberRef`.
 *
 * ___
 *
 * So when we create a runtime, we have the opportunity to set the initial values of the `FiberRef`s
 * for 'main' fibers created by that runtime.
 *
 * Finally, the `RuntimeFlags` is a number representing bitflags that control ultra low-level runtime behavior
 * check out the api docs for more info if you are interested.
