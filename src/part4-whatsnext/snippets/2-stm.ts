/**
 * Many times we want to share state between different parts of our application.
 * and its crucial that updates to this state are *atomic* and *consistent*.
 *
 * The *STM module* provides a way to do this.
 * It is a port of the Haskell STM and features an api that is very similar to the one you're used to in effect.
 *
 * Instead of a `Effect<A, E, R>` to represent a program with side effects,
 * we have a `STM<A, E, R>` to represent a transaction.
 * No side effects are allowed in a transaction, only pure computations and updates to state.
 *
 *
 * Just like how creating an effect does not run it, creating a transaction does not run it.
 * Only when we `commit` the transaction, it runs.
 * If any of the computations in the transaction fail, the transaction is rolled back and retried.
 *
 * Think of STM like a completely separate world from the rest of your program.
 * When you commit a transaction, even if it is made up of many different computations,
 * to the rest of your program, it looks like a single atomic operation.
 *
 * You can think of this like how the function passed to `Effect.sync` gets run.
 * It is guaranteed to run until it completes or fails, in one single synchronous step.
 * STM is like writing in the effect style, with tracked errors and dependencies but with this same guarantee.
 * But now with the additional guarantee that if there is a failure, the whole transaction is rolled back.
 *
 * Technically 'rolled back' is not the right term, because the transaction is not actually run until it is committed,
 * so it's more like all the queued up operations are just thrown away.
 *
 *
 * STM doesn't work on any state, but effect provides `T_` variants of many of effect's data types:
 * The core of these is `TRef` which is a transactional reference to a value.
 *
 * just like how get/set/update operations on a Ref return an Effect
 * the same operations on a TRef return an STM

/**
 * Q: What guarantees does STM give us?
 *
 * 1. Atomicity: Each transfer operation is atomic.
 * 		If any part of the transfer fails (e.g., due to insufficient funds),
 * 		the whole transaction is rolled back, ensuring account balances are never
 * 		left in an inconsistent state.
 * 2. Consistency:
 * 		The STM ensures the consistency of the bank system by making sure all
 * 		operations either complete fully or have no effect, maintaining the
 * 		invariant that the total amount of money in the system remains constant.
 * 3. Isolation: Each transfer operation is isolated from others.
 * 		Intermediate states during a transfer are not visible to other
 * 		transactions, preventing any inconsistent reads.
 *
 * STM is a powerful tool for managing shared state in a concurrent environment.
 * It enabled these benefits without locks, and is a powerful tool for managing
 * shared state in a concurrent environment.
 * Because js is single threaded, we can be 100% sure when we commit a
 * transaction, it will run to completion without any other transactions running
 * in between.
 *
 * One final note about immutability and STM.
 * Immutability is what enables STM to work, because it rolls back to a previous state
 * because it can be sure that those previous states have not been modified
