 * Sharing a mutable state between different parts of your program is a common problem.

 *
 * Effects solution to this problem is the `Ref` type.
 * You probably know what a `Ref` is if you have used `React` or `Vue` before.
 * Its basically just an object with a `current` property that can be mutated.
 * Because objects are passed by reference, you can share the same `Ref` between different parts of your program.
 * And access the same value from different places.
 *
 * Additionally, all operations on a `Ref` are effectful,
